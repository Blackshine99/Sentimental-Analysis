# Sentimental-Analysis

This Project extracts tweets using "Tweepy", a python library which are based on Demonetization. A Twitter Developer Account is needed to access the tweets using the twitter API. 

Once the tweets are extracted, they are preprocessed, and a sentiment value is obtained for each tweets to classify them as Positive, Negative or Neutral. From this data obtained, some Data Visualisation and Exploratory Data Anlysis is performed.
